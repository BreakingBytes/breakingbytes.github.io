# A case for More Experts in Management

## Intro

First off, let me say that I don't think you need to be an expert to be a good manager. I also believe the corollary, that you don't necessarily need to be an expert top be a good individual contributor. Sure it helps, but there may be other traits that are more influential to making either good contributions or better management decisions.

A mentor once told me, when hiring, look for intelligence versus skillset, because a fast & flexible learner continues to be useful when a project ends, but a finite skillset will eventually be obsolete. My definition of intelligence has evolved, and now I think he was really talking about mindsets. I believe a growth mindset might be even more important than expertise
