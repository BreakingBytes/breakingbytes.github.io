Summary: Empathy & a growth mindset are equally important to both managers & individual contributors.

# A case for More Experts in Management

## Intro

First off, let me say that I don't think you need to be an expert to be a good manager. I also believe the corollary, that you don't necessarily need to be an expert top be a good individual contributor. Sure it helps, but there may be other traits that are more influential to making either good contributions or better management decisions.

A mentor once told me, when hiring, look for intelligence versus skillset, because a fast & flexible learner continues to be useful when a project ends, but a finite skillset will eventually be obsolete. My definition of intelligence has evolved, and now I think he was really talking about mindsets. I believe a growth mindset & empathy might be even more important than expertise or leadership.

## Maximize

In my opinion, there is a common misconception that experts lack leadership skills, or that their unique skills are better utilized as individual contributors. However, this artificial perception blocks others with the potential to contribute unique perspectives from collaborating, and it creates a void of subject matter expertise & experience in leadership. Instead it overheats the stereotype of the alpha Male boss and the nerdy, absent minded professor. I strongly feel this lack of diversity in leadership & individual contributions is a real missed opportunity to maximize the potential of all of the unique & special voices & experiences in an organization. This opportunity cost limits growth and sustainability, and I would bet these types of businesses die from starvation & cannibalism as experts frustrated from a lack of voice give up, and leaders fail to listen to these valuable perspectives opting for short term gains and cash out before they crash & burn.
