# Reassessing Risk in Mountians

[Snake Dike](http://www.supertopo.com/rock-climbing/Yosemite-Valley-Half-Dome-Snake-Dike)
is on the southwest shoulder of Half Dome, perhaps the most recognizable rock face in
Yosemite Valley. Although considered a moderate climb, rated 5.7 R, it's sometimes called
"Snake Hike" because it's serious commitment with pretty huge exposure.

Understanding risk on Snake Dike is important. This climb requires planning, good timing,
a bit of skill, and lots of luck. More importantly though, you need to be constantly
aware of changing conditions, how they can affect the risk, and whether bailing is stil
an easy option. Evaluating risk is one of 

- Any event has a distribution of possible outcomes, some that are more favorable than others and some that are definitely undesirable.
- The distribution might not be random, in other words some outcomes might be more likely than others.
- Risk assessment is a measure of the possibility of favorable and undesirable outcomes.
- Each person's or party's tolerance for risk is a choice that depends on trade offs between the chances of favorable vs. undesired outcomes.
- changing conditions force you to reavaluate the rist and make new choices.
- Sometimes conditions and risk can change quickly, leaving you exposed to greater risk.
- Exposure in theoretical terms is a measure of the level risk you've accepted but in practical terms it's measured in how far or long it will take to escape danger and get to help.
- climbing in the mountains automatically increases your exposure because it can be difficult to escape the rock safely.
- climbing in the backcountry can increase exposure significantly because in addition to a safe retreat you may also need to hike and drive significant distances before you can get help.
- Dangers in the mountains include route finding, getting caught in bad weather, darkness, lightning strikes, equipment failure, missing or losing equipment, falls, injuries, death
- learning to evaluate rish in changing conditions is an important skill that can have practical advantages in all aspects of your life.
- it can help you tolerate uncertainty, because reality is both full of possiblities and uncertainty
- it can help you rule out unlikely or scenarios with no serious consequences
