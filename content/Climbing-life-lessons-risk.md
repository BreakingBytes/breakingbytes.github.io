# Reassessing Risk in Mountians

[Snake Dike](http://www.supertopo.com/rock-climbing/Yosemite-Valley-Half-Dome-Snake-Dike)
is on the southwest shoulder of Half Dome, perhaps the most recognizable rock face in
Yosemite Valley. Although considered a moderate climb, rated 5.7 R, it's sometimes called
"Snake Hike" because it's a serious commitment with pretty huge exposure.

Understanding risk on Snake Dike is important. This climb requires planning, good timing,
a bit of skill, and lots of luck. More importantly though, you need to be constantly
aware of changing conditions, how they can affect your risk, and whether bailing is still
an easy option. Evaluating risk is one of climbing's life lessons.

Snake Dike is an all day climb. The approach is a 6 mile, 3-hour hike up 2500-ft that starts
at Happy Isles behind Curry Village and follows the Mist Trail, one of my favorites.
Unfortunately, our 4am start was quickly foiled by rain, but our good timing gave us some
flexibility, so we decided to wait it out for at least an hour and then reassess. Lucky for us
our patience was rewarded, and within the hour we were back on the trail. We decided to pick up
the pace a bit to make up for the lost time. Getting caught in a thunderstrom can have deadly
consequences for climbers, so even though there was no rain in the forecast that day, we didn't
know if the weather would turn bad again later that afternoon. Same as for climbers, descending
the cables from Half Dome in a thunderstorm is a death sentence. We also didn't want to hike out
in the dark, although we had brought our torches and some emergency overnight gear just in case.
There's always trade offs to consider in the backcountry, so we tried to pack as lightly as we
could to move fast yet still be safe. There's a saying in the mountains:

> Speed is saftey.

It means don't waste time, so we didn't. Ok, well maybe we stopped to take a few photos of the
breathtaking views.

I had climbed Snake Dike once before with a large group of experienced climbers, and I'd been on the
Mist Trail numerous times, so I had good intuition for finding the right path to turn off the trail,
and miraculously we nailed the approach. We ate a quick snack, tied on our climbing shoes, strapped
on our harnesses, clipped on a light rack (mostly slings & quickdraws), and tackled the first pitch
which is actually one of the 5.7 cruxes of the climb. The "R" stands for "runout" which means there's
no protection. That pretty much describes most of Snake Dike, but the first pitch is especially gnarly.
It starts on typical Yosemite glacial polish with tiny microedges that you can friction climb up to a
roof where you can finally place your first solid piece and exhale a huge sigh of relief. If you slip on
this slab, you'll get some serious scrapes as you tumble back to the base of the climb. In researching
for this blog, I read an
[incident report from YOSAR](https://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/rescue-from-near-snake-dike-half-dome.htm)
about a couple that were off route but slipped on similar frictiony slab, tumbled to the base, and
dragged the belayer who was not clipped to anything through a talus field. She had a punctured lung, a
fractured pelvis, and broke two vertebra. Climbing can be especially dangerous if you're unlucky, don't 
take precautions, and fail to assess your risk carefully. I'm not trying to scare you, lots of things
are dangerous, that's why it's important to know your risk and make conscious decisions. Anyway, I
pulled the roof, shimmied up to the ledge and made the only anchor with pro I'd need during the entire
climb. From there on out is was bolt city.

That's the SERENE anchor, a cordelet with 3 equalized cams, _a la_
[climbing anchors by Jon Long](http://falcon.com/books/9780762782079). Pay attention
to that black webbing because it's got a bit part in this story later on. I swear
my second has a backup clove hitch out of the frame you can't see, so he can escape
the belay.

There's one more sketchy traverse on frictiony slab protected by a single bolt, and
then the rest of Snake Dike is all jugs and 5 easy. You should download the
[free supertopo](http://www.supertopo.com/topos/yosemite/snakedike.pdf) if you're
serious about climbing Snake Dike. I had tried to memorize it, because there are so
many bolts on this climb that it's easy to either stop early or skip an anchor.
People talk about girth hitching chicken heads but the dike doesn't really take
protection. It's just a long juggy extrusion that you follow like a ladder.

All the rest of the pitches 5 easy but super runout with just a single
bolt every 60 feet or so. Some of the pitches have zero bolts! But every so often
you come across a pair of bolts that look like an anchor, that are for shorter ropes.
Knowing where to belay is part of route finding that can speed up your climb, and
remember, "speed is safety!" Clip the wrong bolts though, and you might find yourself
and your partner simul-climbing.

- Any event has a distribution of possible outcomes, some that are more favorable than others and some that are definitely undesirable.
- The distribution might not be random, in other words some outcomes might be more likely than others.
- Risk assessment is a measure of the possibility of favorable and undesirable outcomes.
- Each person's or party's tolerance for risk is a choice that depends on trade offs between the chances of favorable vs. undesired outcomes.
- changing conditions force you to reavaluate the rist and make new choices.
- Sometimes conditions and risk can change quickly, leaving you exposed to greater risk.
- Exposure in theoretical terms is a measure of the level risk you've accepted but in practical terms it's measured in how far or long it will take to escape danger and get to help.
- climbing in the mountains automatically increases your exposure because it can be difficult to escape the rock safely.
- climbing in the backcountry can increase exposure significantly because in addition to a safe retreat you may also need to hike and drive significant distances before you can get help.
- Dangers in the mountains include route finding, getting caught in bad weather, darkness, lightning strikes, equipment failure, missing or losing equipment, falls, injuries, death
- learning to evaluate rish in changing conditions is an important skill that can have practical advantages in all aspects of your life.
- it can help you tolerate uncertainty, because reality is both full of possiblities and uncertainty
- it can help you rule out unlikely or scenarios with no serious consequences
