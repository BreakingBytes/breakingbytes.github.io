# Reassessing Risk in Mountians

[Snake Dike](http://www.supertopo.com/rock-climbing/Yosemite-Valley-Half-Dome-Snake-Dike)
is on the southwest shoulder of Half Dome, perhaps the most recognizable rock face in
Yosemite Valley. Although considered a moderate climb, rated 5.7 R, it's sometimes called
"Snake Hike" because it's a serious commitment with pretty huge exposure.

Understanding risk on Snake Dike is important. This climb requires planning, good timing,
a bit of skill, and lots of luck. More importantly though, you need to be constantly
aware of changing conditions, how they can affect your risk, and whether bailing is stil
an easy option. Evaluating risk is one of climbings life lessons.

Snake Dike is an all day climb. The approach is a 6 mile, 3-hour hike up 2500-ft that starts
at Happy Isles behind Curry Village and follows the Mist Trail, one of my favorites in the
valley. Unfortunately, our 4am start was quickly foiled by rain, but our good timing gave us
some flexibility, so we decided to wait it out for at least an hour and then reassess. Lucky
for us our patience was rewarded, and within the hour we were back on the trail. We decided
to pick up the pace a bit to make up for the lost time. Getting caught in a thunderstrom can
have deadly consequences for climbers, so even though there was no rain in the forecast that
day, we didn't know if the weather would turn bad again later that afternoon. There's a saying
in the mountings:

> Speed is saftey



- Any event has a distribution of possible outcomes, some that are more favorable than others and some that are definitely undesirable.
- The distribution might not be random, in other words some outcomes might be more likely than others.
- Risk assessment is a measure of the possibility of favorable and undesirable outcomes.
- Each person's or party's tolerance for risk is a choice that depends on trade offs between the chances of favorable vs. undesired outcomes.
- changing conditions force you to reavaluate the rist and make new choices.
- Sometimes conditions and risk can change quickly, leaving you exposed to greater risk.
- Exposure in theoretical terms is a measure of the level risk you've accepted but in practical terms it's measured in how far or long it will take to escape danger and get to help.
- climbing in the mountains automatically increases your exposure because it can be difficult to escape the rock safely.
- climbing in the backcountry can increase exposure significantly because in addition to a safe retreat you may also need to hike and drive significant distances before you can get help.
- Dangers in the mountains include route finding, getting caught in bad weather, darkness, lightning strikes, equipment failure, missing or losing equipment, falls, injuries, death
- learning to evaluate rish in changing conditions is an important skill that can have practical advantages in all aspects of your life.
- it can help you tolerate uncertainty, because reality is both full of possiblities and uncertainty
- it can help you rule out unlikely or scenarios with no serious consequences
