# Life Lessons from an Offwidth

The [East Buttress of El Capitan](http://www.supertopo.com/rock-climbing/Yosemite-Valley-El-Capitan-East-Buttress) is one of the best but hardest climbs I've ever been on. It's long & sustained, with huge exposure & beautiful, sweeping views of the valley & Middle Cathedral. In typical Yosemite fashion, it challenges you right from the get go with a steep chimney overlooking a 1,000-foot drop. Then on the 8th pitch, after you been climbing for a few hours, over 2,000 feet above the valley floor, there's a classic Yosemite offwidth. Like glacial polish, Yosemite offwidths are a ritual you can't avoid. You just have to stash your ego, open your heart, and humbly listen to what the great mother is trying to teach you.

An offwidth is a difficult climb. It's too big for hand jams, but too small to chimney. Everybody has advice for offwidths: armbars, chicken wings, kneebars, shoulder jams, laybacks, you name it.
