# Life Lessons from an Offwidth

The East Buttress of El Capitan is one of the hardest climbs I've ever been on. It's long & sustained, with huge exposure & beautiful, sweeping views of the valley & Middle Cathedral. In typical Yosemite fashion, it challenges you right from the get go. Then on the 8th pitch, over 2,000 feet above the valley floor, it's a classic Yosemite offwidth. Like glacial polish, it's a ritual you can't avoid. An offwidth is a difficult climb, too big for hand jams, but too small to chimney.
