Title: Moving to Pelican at GitHub Pages

So this is goodbye to Google Blogger and my old blog at
[Poquito Picante](http://poquitopicante.blogspot.com/), although I'll try to
keep [Breaking Bytes](https://breakingbytes.blogspot.com/) up to date if I can
figure out how to make a commit hook that posts the generated content using the
[Blogger API v3](https://developers.google.com/blogger/).

And this is hello to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)! I did a very quick
[search for static site generators](https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html)
like Pelican, Hyde and a few others, and Pelican quickly emerged as the most
popular. [Also Kenneth Reitz said to use it.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4928719)

So far Pelican usage is a snap, just follow
[the quickstart in their documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html).
So this is my very first, albeit very short, post for my new blog site. Why leave
Google Blogger?

- I've wanted to for a very long time, b/c I wanted to manage my blog using
  Git.
- My old blog is now being crawled every few hours which just seems weird.
- I prefer my `breakingbytes` handle to "Poquito Picante" which is just a
  silly alliteration.
